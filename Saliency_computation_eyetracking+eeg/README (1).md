# Saliency Computation

Saliency Computation can be seen as such : Computing attention and preference saliency based off data from the EEG and Eye Tracking Raw data

## File Format

Both the processing files are in python notebook format for a more clearer chronological walkthrough for processing

## Eye_processing

This file focuses on processing and computing saliency based only on eye data


## EEG_Eye_processing
This file focuses on processing and computing saliency mainly based on eeg. It then computes a combined saliency from both eye and eeg data. 

## Final Iteration
The files only include the methods employed in the final iterations
