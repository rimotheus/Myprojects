    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third assignment for 50.055 Machine Learning Operations. \n",
    "The third and fourth assignment together form the course group project. You will be working in your project groups to build a chatbot which can answer questions about SUTD to prospective students.\n",

    "\n",
    "**This assignment is a group assignment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the instructions in this notebook carefully\n",
    "- Add your solution code and answers in the appropriate places. The questions are marked as **QUESTION:**, the places where you need to add your code and text answers are marked as **ADD YOUR SOLUTION HERE**\n",
    "- The completed notebook, including your added code and generated output will be your submission for the assignment.\n",
    "- The notebook should execute without errors from start to finish when you select \"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells..\". Please test this before submission.\n",
    "- Use the SUTD Education Cluster to solve and test the assignment. If you work on another environment, minimally test your work on the SUTD Education Cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rubric for assessment** \n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be graded using the following criteria. \n",
    "1. Code executes: your code should execute without errors. The SUTD Education cluster should be used to ensure the same execution environment.\n",
    "2. Correctness: the code should produce the correct result or the text answer should state the factual correct answer.\n",
    "3. Style: your code should be written in a way that is clean and efficient. Your text answers should be relevant, concise and easy to understand.\n",
    "4. Partial marks will be awarded for partially correct solutions.\n",
    "5. Creativity and innovation: in this assignment you have more freedom to design your solution, compared to the first assignments. You can show of your creativity and innovative mindset. \n",
    "6. There is a maximum of 225 points for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT policy** \n",
    "\n",
    "If you use AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to solve the assignment questions, you need to be transparent about its use and mark AI-generated content as such. In particular, you should include the following in addition to your final answer:\n",
    "- A copy or screenshot of the prompt you used\n",
    "- The name of the AI model\n",
    "- The AI generated output\n",
    "- An explanation why the answer is correct or what you had to change to arrive at the correct answer\n",
